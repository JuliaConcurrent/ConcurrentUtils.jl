    Promise{T}()
    Promise()

Create a promise of type `T`; i.e., a memory location that holds a value of type `T` that
can be set once and retrieved asynchronously.

# Extended help

For an explanation on the concept, see:
[Futures and promises - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).

## Examples

```julia
julia> using ConcurrentUtils

julia> p = Promise{Int}();

julia> try_fetch(p)
Try.Err: NotSetError()

julia> put!(p, 123);

julia> fetch(p)
123

julia> try_put!(p, 456)
Try.Err: OccupiedError{Int64}(123)
```

## Supported operations

A `promise::Promise{T}` supports the following operations:

* `put!(promise, value)`: Set a `value`; throws an error if some value has already been set.
* [`try_put!(promise, value)`](@ref try_put!): Try to set a `value`.
* `fetch(promise)`: Obtain a value that the `promise` holds. Wait if necessary.
* `wait(promise)`: Wait for a value to be set.
* [`try_fetch(promise)`](@ref try_fetch): Try to obtain an existing value in the `promise`.
* [`try_fetch_or!(thunk, promise)`](@ref try_fetch_or!): Try to get a value or set a value
  generated by `thunk`.
* [`fetch_or!(thunk, promise)`](@ref): Similar to `try_fetch_or!` but  the returned value
  does not indicate if `thunk` is called or not.
